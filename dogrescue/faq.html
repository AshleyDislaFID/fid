<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):<h1>

<h2>What do I need to adopt a pet?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Please bring a driver&apos;s license and payment method.</p>

<h2>What is the adoption process, and what is included with the adoption of a pet?</h2>
<p class="faqp">The adoption process begins with visiting the shelter in person and interacting with a prospective pet. After the interaction has occurred, an adoption application must be completed. Once the application is approved and the fees are paid, the process is complete. As soon as the pet has met its mandatory hold requirements, it will be ready to go home!</p>

<h2>Can residents outside of Dakota Creek adopt?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes. An adopter need not live within Dakota Creek to adopt. A valid identification is still required for the adoption.
</p>
<h2>When can I expect to pick up my new pet?</h2>
<p class="faqp">When an adoption is approved and the animal has met the mandatory hold requirements (typically 3-5 days), the pet is good to go home. DCDR will notify the adopter on the day of the pet&apos;s surgery and the adopter will have 48 hours to pick up. Pick up is between the hours of 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.
</p>
<h2>Can Animal Services assist with transport?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Animal Services cannot transport pets. However, if an interested adopter lives out of town and is unable to visit the shelter, DCDR encourages them to reach out to a registered rescue partner for assistance.
</p>
<h2>What are the requirements for a pet owner in Dakota Creek?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Pet owners in Dakota Creek must maintain a current rabies vaccination for their pets. They must also supply adequate shelter, food and water, and keep the animal properly confined.
</p>
<h2>Are all animals sterilized prior to adoption?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Animal Services advocates on behalf of the importance of sterilization to help curb pet overpopulation. When adopting from DCDR, the sterilization cost is included in the adoption fee. The majority of animals adopted through DCDR are sterilized, health permitting. In rare cases an animal may not be a candidate for sterilization based on an observed health condition or age.
<br><br>
Prior to spay or neuter procedures, each animal receives a pre-surgical examination which helps shelter veterinarians determine whether or not the animal is a candidate for sterilization. In rare cases, a condition may not be apparent and surfaces only during the actual procedure, which could result in an unexpected complication.
<br><br>
Approximately 10% of DCDR&apos;s shelter dogs are diagnosed with heartworm disease. Dogs that are heartworm positive may still be candidates for spay and neuter procedures. Veterinarians conduct a hands-on physical examination of the dog prior to, which includes listening to the dog&apos;s heart and lungs as an aid to whether or not the animal is a candidate for sterilization. Heartworm disease has various stages, which is why the condition itself does not exclude a dog from being spayed or neutered. However, if a veterinarian does not believe the animal is healthy enough for the procedure, they will not proceed. These decisions are made on a case by case basis. It is crucial that any new family fully understand the needs of the animal prior to leaving the shelter, especially one with heartworm disease, or one that has experienced a complication during the spay/neuter process.
<br><br>
Animals with medical conditions that cannot be spayed/neutered can still be released to new families. They are welcomed back at the shelter for sterilization if their health improves in the future.
<br><br>
From time to time, the shelter has been asked to provide their policy on the sterilization of heartworm positive dogs. Because each animal&apos;s needs are unique, it is the policy of DCDR that its team of licensed veterinarians maintain full discretion in determining the best treatment plan for sick or injured animals, in addition to which are candidates for surgical procedures.
